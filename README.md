# dollar-price-to-google-sheets

App that gets the ARS/USD exchange rate from Ambito and writes it to a Google Spreadsheet. 

Also used this project as an opportunity to use Bun as this was made with Bun v1.0.23. I came across some interesting stuff like the fact that Axios does not fucking work with Bun yet.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```
